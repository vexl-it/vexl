# Account deletion website

**This page is not a priority so please excuse any linting / configuration innaccuracies. We rather focus on making the app experience better.**

The purpose of this website is to allow user to remove their account from the web as per [Google Play Store requirements](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/13327111?hl=en). Deleting account using this website won't delete user's offers, since they are not connected to the phone number. The keys to remove the offers are stored only at user's device and there is no other way how to authorize author of the offer...

This website can be accessed on https://app.vexl.it.
