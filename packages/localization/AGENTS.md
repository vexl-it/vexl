# AGENTS

Purpose: Localization utilities and translation resources shared by client surfaces.

Stack: TypeScript, JSON resource files.

Gotchas:

- Only update `base.json` when adding translations. Other languages are handled by Crowdin -- do not edit them manually.
- Coordinate locale additions with mobile/dashboard to avoid missing keys.
